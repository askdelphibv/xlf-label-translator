# XLF/XLIFF Label Translator

Little utility that uses Azure Gognitive Services to automatically machine-translate your XLF labels in your Angular application.

Upon every run builds an Excel file with 'overrides' that contains the translated labels. These can be used to override the machine translations.

When added to the folder with a specific name, they will be used as input every time the tool runs.
